# Ultrawide: what is known, what was changed

Working notes for the ultrawide mode (branch `ultrawide`). Read this before touching the camera, the
HUD or the renderer's squeeze for it. Addresses are game version 13.0.5, `main` loaded at `0x7100000000`
(`main+0x1234` = `0x7100001234`). Every claim says how it was found; **measured** means a run showed it.

Goals agreed with the owner: the fight must stay exactly what 16:9 computes (online play); the HUD
stays in the middle 16:9, unstretched; the P1/CPU tags and the magnifying glasses sit on their fighters;
the camera should feel like 16:9's (centred, pulling in, not showing much past the stage).

## HUD decisions

One row per HUD element: what it does in each view, and why. The words are
[ULTRAWIDE-CONTEXT.md](ULTRAWIDE-CONTEXT.md)'s; what is left to do is in [ULTRAWIDE-TODO.md](ULTRAWIDE-TODO.md).

| Element | Wide | Zoomed | Hybrid | Status | Decided, and why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tags (P1, CPU) | over the fighter | over the fighter | over the fighter | done | 2026-11-11: they follow the view the picture shows (fixed: the HUD read the camera's own matrix, not the moved one). |
| Magnifying bubbles | at the 16:9 edge | at the picture's edge | at the picture's edge | done | 2026-11-11: in the wide view the fighter is still in the picture past the 16:9 edge, so a bubble at the far edge looks like a jump off-screen. When a bubble shows stays the game's 16:9 rule (a useful cue near the blast zone). |
| Fighter in a bubble | drawn while inside the picture | hidden (the game's) | hidden (the game's) | to do | 2026-11-11: in the wide view the fighter should simply stay visible. |
| Triple arrows | follow the bubble | follow the bubble | follow the bubble | to do | 2026-11-11: they point to an off-screen fighter, so they go where the bubble goes. |
| Damage meters | 16:9 view | 16:9 view | 16:9 view | done | 2026-11-11: left with the 16:9 view. |
| Timer | 16:9 view | 16:9 view | 16:9 view | to decide | Placement on a wider picture not decided yet. |
| Minimap | - | - | - | to decide | Not looked at yet. |
| Pause menu | - | - | - | to decide | Not looked at yet. |
| Training mode elements | - | - | - | to decide | Not looked at yet. |
| Menus, loading screens | - | - | - | to do | The side areas are to be filled (black, or a blur of the middle: owner's call). |

## Settings and switches (Direct3D 11 only: `renderer = direct3d11`)

The words used here (picture shape, wide / zoomed / hybrid view, stage range, ...) are defined in
[ULTRAWIDE-CONTEXT.md](ULTRAWIDE-CONTEXT.md).

| Setting | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `display.ini` `aspect = 16:9 \| auto \| W:H` (`SSBU_ASPECT` over it) | The picture shape, at most 32:9. 16:9 (the default): nothing changes. auto: the primary monitor's. Also in the settings menu ("Picture shape"): taken at the next frame, in fights too. 16:9 while an online match is set up or under way (taken before its GO!, never inside an online fight), and for the whole session unless `renderer = direct3d11` (auto draws with Vulkan on AMD, NVIDIA and Intel cards, not ported yet). |
| `display.ini` `view = wide \| zoomed \| hybrid` (`SSBU_VIEW` over it) | The view, with a picture wider than 16:9. Default hybrid. Also in the settings menu ("View"), at once, mid-fight too. |
| `SSBU_GAME_FRAMING_WIDE=1` | The reference view: tells the game itself the picture shape. Changes fights: offline comparison only (`build\aspect_test\liked.bat`). |
| `SSBU_ASPECT_HYBRID`, `SSBU_ASPECT_SCREEN`, `SSBU_NO_2D_CLAMP` | Old tests. To remove. |
| `SSBU_CAMERA_HUNT`, `SSBU_CULL_HUNT`, `SSBU_RCAM_WATCH`, `SSBU_CAM_TRACE`, `SSBU_FRAMING_DUMP`, `SSBU_SHADOW_LOG`, F9 | Research and measurement. The traces stay while views are tuned; the hunts go. |
| `SSBU_GFX_LOG_CB=all` | F4's draw log dumps every constant buffer bank in full. |
| `SSBU_ASPECT_CYCLE=<s>` | Test: 16:9, 21:9, 32:9 asked for in turn every s seconds (in fights too). |
| `SSBU_VIEW_CYCLE=<n>` | Test: the next view every n fight frames, as the menu would (switching mid-fight, checked by replay hash). |

## What the runtime changes (by file)

- `runtime/display.h`, `runtime/gpu_display.c`: the settings. `display_aspect()` is the shape the picture
  has now; the menu or `display.ini` asks for one (`display_set_aspect`), and the renderer takes it at
  its next present (`display_aspect_take`: at once offline, before GO! for an online match, never inside
  an online fight). `display_shape_locked()`: 16:9 for the session unless `renderer = direct3d11`.
  `display_view()` / `display_set_view()`: the view, read every frame. `display_fit` fits the picture
  at the shape.
- `runtime/gpu_d3d11.c`:
  - `scaled_size`: a 16:9 render target is made `shape / (16/9)` times wider (kept as `Surface.wide`).
    At a shape change every 16:9-shaped target is released and made again at the new width on its next
    use (they are looked up by the game's address).
  - The squeeze (in `d3d11_draw`): the game draws 3D wide itself; a 2D draw (no depth test) that is not a
    full-screen pass has its clip-space x divided by the widening (`params.fix[0]`), so the HUD sits in
    the middle 16:9, scissored to it (the game's own scissor squeezed with it).
  - Magnifying bubbles: known by the portrait's vertex program and the two draws after it (ring, arrow),
    moved to the picture's edge in the zoomed and hybrid views (HUD decisions).
  - Research: `cam_hunt_cb`, the F9 picker, the `aspect:` line in F4's draw log.
- `runtime/gpu_menu.c`: the settings menu's Picture shape and View rows (both take effect without a
  restart).
- `runtime/gpu_window.c`: F9 passed to the renderer.
- `runtime/hle_rb_core.c`: `net_match_on()`, whether an online match is set up or under way (ADR 0002).
- `runtime/hle_fight_test.c`: `fight_test_frame0()`, so the camera trace's lines join the fight hash log's.
- `runtime/host.c` (Windows only for now):
  - `wide_camera` (each frame's end): the render camera's width `+0x164` (and `+0x16c`) set from the
    shape when wider than 16:9, written back to 16:9's once when 16:9 returns.
  - `hud_call` and its 12 wrappers: while the HUD's world-to-screen functions run they get 16:9's
    projection and the view the picture shows, so tags land on their fighters (straight through at 16:9).
  - The views, one hook on the game's framing (`framing_hook`, `f_71004fe4f0`) that reads the view every
    frame. Zoomed: the framing and camera-move calls are recorded (`rec_call`) and replayed with the
    picture's shape on a shadow camera of this file's own (`shadow_update`), which the picture follows.
    Wide: the framing run again for the picture's shape (`framing_dump`). Hybrid: the framing left alone,
    the picture's camera slid along the stage range and zoomed in only as needed (`wide_copy`). Nothing
    the fight reads is written.
  - `net_match_watch` (each frame's end, on the game's thread): caches `net_match_on()` for the renderer.
  - Research: the hunts, the camera trace and dumps (behind their switches; see ULTRAWIDE-TODO.md, clean-up).

## The game: render camera

The camera the picture is drawn with. Found: `f_7103747820` (scene set-up, calls `tanf`) reads it and
copies its matrices to the scene globals; dumped live with `SSBU_CAM_DUMP` (**measured**).

Address: `*(*(main+0x5337ce8) + 0x490)` is a manager `m`; the camera is `*(m + 0xe0)` when
`*(m + 0xd8)` is set, else the default at `main+0x5334060`.

| Offset | Value at 16:9 | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| +0x150 | 0 | projection kind (0 perspective) |
| +0x15c | 30, 41 | field of view, degrees (41: the entry; 30: the fight) |
| +0x160 | 0.5236 | field of view, radians |
| +0x164 | 1920 | width: **the projection is built from this** (widening it alone widened the projection, measured) |
| +0x168 | 1080 | height |
| +0x16c | 1.77778 | width / height, computed as 1920 x (1/1080) - not bit-equal to 16/9, which is why searches for 16/9 missed it |
| +0x170, +0x174 | 1920, 1080 | a second size; widening it changed nothing seen |
| +0x178, +0x17c | 1/1920, 1/1080 | reciprocals of the second size |
| +0x1d0 | 4x4 | view, row-vector (`p * V`), translation row at +0x200 |
| +0x210 | 4x4 | identity seen |
| +0x250 | 4x4 | inverse view; camera position at +0x280 |
| +0x290 | 4x4 | projection: +0x290 x scale (cot(fov/2) / aspect), +0x2a4 y scale (cot(fov/2)) |
| +0x2d0 | 4x4 | inverse projection |
| +0x310 | 1920 1080 1/1920 1/1080 | another size |

Widening the width at +0x164 each frame fixed the culling of floors and background pieces at the
picture's sides (**measured**) and does not change the fight (**measured**, below).

Copies on the way to the GPU: the scene constant buffer (`cb3`, field of view 41) is written by
`f_7103553980` (a loop that flushes CPU-side buffers to GPU ones with memcpy); per-draw `cb8` copies
(field of view 30) by `f_710355a980` / `f_710355ad30` and `main+0xa5c80`. Found with `SSBU_CAMERA_HUNT`
(page write-watch), **measured**.

## The game: game camera (`app::`) - the one that frames the fight

The camera logic: where the camera goes, what is off screen. Its state feeds the fight.

- Camera manager: `*(*(main+0x52b8f00))`, call it `M` (`app::camera::*` and `sv_camera_manager::*` read it):
  - `M+0xc20` .. `+0xc2c`: the stage's camera range, left, right, top, bottom (`sv_camera_manager::camera_range`,
    `main+0x2282ea0`; left/right order from the framing code's min/max).
  - `M+0xc30` .. `+0xc3c`: the dead area, the blast zones (`app::camera::get_dead_area`, `main+0x15cb9e0`).
  - `M+0xeb0`: the visible range's centre; `M+0xf38` x `M+0xf68`: its half height; `M+0xf58`: its
    width / height. `app::camera::get_camera_range` (`main+0x15cb960`) returns centre +- (half height x
    aspect, half height). Read from code, not yet dumped live.
- The framing: `f_71004fe4f0(camera, out, ..., s0 = aspect)` (calls `tanf`) fits the fighters' camera
  ranges, clamped to the stage's (`+0x224..+0x230` against `M+0xc20..`). Its caller copies the aspect
  from `*(camera + 0x8) + 0x128` to `camera + 0x134` every update; `app::item::is_clip_in_camera`
  (`main+0x15c46a0`) reads `+0x134..+0x140`.
- `main+0x4472c5c`: the only 16:9 float in `main` (rodata). Read by the framing code's other branch and
  the main menu's 3D camera, not by the fight's projection (**measured**: patching it widened the main
  menu's panels only).

**Widening this camera's aspect (both places) changes the fight** (**measured**: a scripted 32:9 fight
with it differs from 16:9 at frame 578, in damage - fighters past the old 16:9 edge took the
magnifying glass's off-screen damage). With it widened, though, the camera framed the wide picture
the way the owner wanted: it pulled in, stayed inside the stage, and fighters past the old 16:9 edge
were drawn (the game hides a fighter in the magnifying glass) with the glass at the real edge.

### How the 16:9 camera behaves (measured, 2026-11-11)

A 4-player replay (frames 10-4170; camera range x -170..170, y -50..130; blast zones x +-230) watched at
16:9 with `SSBU_CAM_TRACE=10` and `SSBU_FIGHT_HASH` (`build\aspect_test\replay169.bat`):

- The game camera is a 16:9 rectangle on the fighters' plane: centre `M+0xeb0`, half height
  `M+0xf38 x M+0xf68`, half width = half height x 16/9.
- The render camera follows it: same x, a little above it (pitched ~5 degrees down), at the distance
  that shows that half height (half height = distance x tan(fov / 2)); the field of view itself moves too
  (26-30 degrees seen).
- The rectangle stays inside the stage's camera range: its left edge stopped at -169, -166, -167 against
  the range's -170 (frames 2110, 3010, 3310). That is the 16:9 feel: it slides with the fighters and stops
  at the range.
- Off screen = outside that rectangle: at frame 2110 two fighters at x -197 and -211 (past the range,
  inside the blast zone).
- At 32:9 the same height is twice as wide: frame 2110's rectangle would run -261..109, 91 past the range
  and 31 past the blast zone. Zoomed out (half height ~75 and more) a 32:9 view is wider than the whole
  camera range, so no sideways slide can keep it inside: it has to zoom in, as the game's own framing did
  when its aspect was widened.

The framing camera object (x0 of `f_71004fe4f0`; dumped with `SSBU_FRAMING_DUMP`, a hook that only
reads; same replay):

| Offset | Meaning (measured against the trace and the fighters' positions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| +0x70 (x, y) | where the camera looks now |
| +0x90 (x, y, z) | where it is now (z: its distance) |
| +0x80, +0xa0 | the same two as its goal: it eases from now to goal |
| +0xb0 | 30, 30, 0.6 (field of view, ...) |
| +0x1f8 (left, right, top, bottom) | the goal rectangle, already 16:9 (fighters' box plus margins, stretched to 16:9) |
| +0x208 (left, right, top, bottom) | the visible rectangle now (16:9, inside the camera range) |
| +0x224..+0x230 | the slot the framing clamps against the range: +-FLT_MAX here (empty) |

The fighters' own box is not kept: the game works it out and stores only the 16:9 result. A wide
framing needs it (spread sideways: zoom in; spread up and down: cannot).

### The liked mode against the visual-only framing (measured 2026-11-11)

`SSBU_GAME_FRAMING_WIDE=1` (with `SSBU_ASPECT_NATIVE`) is the mode the owner liked: the game's own camera
framing told the wide aspect. It changes the fight (kept for reference: `build\aspect_test\liked.bat`,
offline only). A live 1v1 on Bridge of Eldin in it, against the owner's 16:9 replay of the same match-up
and the visual-only framing (`SSBU_WIDE_FRAMING`), view half height by the fighters' spread:

| spread | 16:9 | liked | visual-only |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0-49 | 42 | 41 | 42 |
| 150-199 | 64 | 61 | 59 |
| 300+ | 95 | 48 | 84 |

The liked mode keeps a close shot when the fighters spread out (the wide picture covers them), and
slides off their middle to stay inside the stage's range; past the range at spread 300+: 0. The
visual-only framing zooms out as 16:9 does: 259 past. So the zoom is not decided by `f_71004fe4f0`.

The camera update (`f_71004fdc10`) then calls `f_71004fec80` twice: with s0 = the stored aspect
(+0x134), x2 = +0x70 (the camera's now), x3 = +0x110; and with s0 = main+0x4472c5c (16:9), x2 = +0xc0,
x3 = +0x118. These move the camera's state; the zoom is likely there. Setting the stored aspect only during the
second `f_71004fe4f0` call did not change the picture; the hash difference seen then (frame 2474) was
the results screen's random victory pose, not the fight. Compare hash logs up to the "GAME!" frame (the
fighters jump to x 1100 / 0 for the results).

### Decisions (owner, 2026-11-11)

(The styles below were renamed: **full** is now the wide view, **stage** the hybrid view; the zoomed view came later.)

- Two camera styles, both kept as options: **full** (the visual-only framing as it is: everything the
  fight could need is in view, past the stage if need be) and **stage** (the liked mode's look: the view
  clamped to the stage's camera range at the full width, zoom fitted to the wide picture), the latter
  to be made fight-identical with a shadow camera (the game's own camera update run on a copy).
- The "stage" style's zoom exists only to hide what lies past the stage (owner, 2026-11-11): stay as
  zoomed out as the full style, slide along the stage first, zoom in only as far as needed to keep
  the picture inside the stage's camera range. The zoomed-out look is preferred.
- The magnifying glass stays where the 16:9 rules put it: it marks a fighter nearing the blast zone,
  which is when it shows anyway. Drawing the fighter instead is for later.
- Stages whose floor runs to the blast zones (Bridge of Eldin) show the oddities most; competitive
  rulesets ban them.

## Driving the game without a person

`build\aspect_test\auto\*.bat` (made by `mk.py` there): `SSBU_SEQ` walks the menus - title (A at tick
600), main menu (RIGHT is Vault, A), Vault (RIGHT is Replays, A), Replay Data (A), the newest replay (A),
Play (A) - with screenshots every few seconds (`SSBU_CAPTURE`, `sheet.py` makes a contact sheet). Each
run takes a copy of the save (`SSBU_DATA_ROOT`). A saved replay plays the same fight every time:
`framing169` (scripted) and a watch by hand hashed the same over 16536 lines.

The same replay at 32:9 (`replay329.bat`, the native mode) hashed the same as at 16:9 over 4039 fight
frames (16153 lines): the second proof that the mode does not change a fight, this time on real play.

## The game: HUD

Drawn by a few vertex programs, all with depth testing off, on the final 1920x1080 target. Found from an
F4 draw log of a fight (`SSBU_GFX_LOG_CB=all`), **measured**:

- Placed elements, `vs_e0758c3ac3507774` (text `ps_340268462afc028d`, images `ps_547eb1f52eda5794`):
  vertex bank 3, first 0x40 bytes, is the element's transform with the screen's: x row `(2/1920, 0, 0, x)`,
  y row `(0, -2/1080, 0, y)`; the corners come in the element's pixels (a storage buffer).
- Shapes, `vs_1669b7d183575986` and 7 others: bank 3 is the screen's mapping (no position) and, at +0x40,
  the element's transform (x row `(scale, 0, 0, x in layout pixels from the middle)`); the vertex buffer
  is a unit square.
- The P1/CPU tags and the magnifying glasses use the same programs as the rest of the HUD: no program
  tells them apart. Their positions come from the render camera's projection through the HUD's
  world-to-screen code. Narrowing each element around its own anchor (instead of squeezing all to the
  middle) put tags right but broke widgets made of pieces (clock and damage digits spread apart) and
  pulled a full-screen element's edges (the yellow bars) into view.
- The 12 functions given 16:9's projection (`main+0x1341670`, `+0x134c690`, `+0x135ccb0`, `+0x13955d0`,
  `+0x13a3f50`, `+0x13a53d0`, `+0x13a67c0`, `+0x13adb10`, `+0x13c8460`, `+0x13ca580`, `+0x13e29d0`,
  `+0x142aed0`): the ones that load the render camera and read +0x290, in that part of `main`. Tags land
  on their fighters with all 12 (**measured**); which of them are needed is not known. In a fight 7 run,
  once a frame each (`+0x135ccb0`, `+0x13955d0`, `+0x13a3f50`, `+0x13adb10`, `+0x13c8460`, `+0x13ca580`,
  `+0x142aed0`); `+0x1341670` and `+0x134c690` not at all.
- They take the **view** from the render camera's own matrix (`cam+0x0`, translation `+0x30`), not from
  the drawing block (`cam+0x1d0`) the views move, and the projection through `*(main+0x53375a8)` (the same
  camera). So the zoom and slide never reached the tags (owner, 2026-11-11: "tags broken on zoomed and
  hybrid"). Fixed: while one runs, the moved translation is put in `cam+0x0` too and put back after (only
  when its rotation is the block's). Bridge of Eldin replay: wide, zoomed, hybrid the same as 16:9.
  `+0x1341670` with bit 0 of x2 builds its view from the camera manager instead (`M+0xeb0`, `+0xec0`, up
  `+0xee0`; look-at in `f_7103559a30`): not seen in fights.
- `sv_camera_manager::world_to_screen` (`main+0x22832c0` -> `f_7101341280`): layout pixels, centre
  (960, 540); in a fight only ever returned the centre (**measured**). Not what places the tags.
- `kozukatasight::screen_width` (`main+0x1646f00`) reads a global at `main+0x744701c` (1920 when 0).
- Yellow bars: an element just past the 16:9 edges; the 2D clip hides it.

## The fight stays the same: how to check

`build\aspect_test\verify\run169.bat` and `run329b.bat` (and `run329.bat`): the same scripted fight
(`SSBU_SEQ`, `SSBU_DETERMINISTIC`, `SSBU_FIXED_SEED`, `SSBU_FIGHT_HASH`; Mario against a level 1 CPU
Donkey Kong, `stage=end`), each with a fresh copy of the save. The menus are walked with the keyboard
(`SSBU_SEQ_KEYBOARD=1`); the fight plays itself and the run ends after 30 s. Then:

```
python tools/dev/fight_hash_diff.py build/aspect_test/verify/run169.fh.txt build/aspect_test/verify/run329b.fh.txt
```

Results (2026-11-10): 16:9 vs 32:9 native with the 16:9 framing: the same over 4036 lines. 16:9 vs 32:9
with the game camera widened: first difference frame 578, damage. A stage not named in
`SSBU_DEBUG_MATCH` comes from the menus, so two runs can differ in stage: name it.

**Scripted live fights jitter** (2026-11-11, `build\aspect_test\auto\mktags.py`, the menu route of
`cmp169`): the same `SSBU_SEQ` polls land the first stick press a frame early or late now and then
(frame 328 or 329, any view, even the same build twice), and the fights part from there. Good for
looking at tags (replays draw none), not for proving a fight the same: use the replays. Tags fade a
few seconds into a fight (16:9 too).

## Tried and dropped

- Patching `main+0x4472c5c`: only the main menu's camera and the framing's other branch.
- Searching memory for 16:9 floats, for perspective matrices of 16:9, for frustum planes (6 or 4,
  either layout): the fight's 16:9 is computed each frame; culling keeps no planes.
- Telling the game the screen is wider (`vi`): ignored, the game's sizes are its own.
- A vertex-shader squeeze (perspective vertices only): right picture, but every vertex program's cache
  is new (18,222 programs, ~1 h of compiling); short effects were skipped while compiling.
- `f_710364b620`'s visible rectangle (+0x950 = height x 16 / 9): 0 x 0 in fights.
- Panning the render camera to keep the stage's range in view, with the rest dimmed (2026-11-11):
  no dimming seen; reverted.

## Done (history)

What is left is in [ULTRAWIDE-TODO.md](ULTRAWIDE-TODO.md). Done, with what was learned:

1. **The hybrid view, fight-identical** (2026-11-11; first called the "stage" style, `SSBU_WIDE_STYLE=stage`):
   the game's camera widened, slid along the stage range and zoomed in only as far as needed to keep the
   picture inside it, never past the 16:9 view. Both replays hash the same as 16:9 up to GAME!; past the
   range: Town and City 0, Bridge of Eldin at most 7 (the game's own 16:9 view). The shadow camera (the
   game's framing replayed on a copy) is kept as `SSBU_WIDE_STYLE=shadow` for research.
2. **Magnifying bubbles at the picture's edge** (2026-11-11): the renderer knows a bubble by its portrait
   (`vs_545fbedf170d65dd`, the fighter's picture from a 128x128 target) and the two draws right after it
   at the same x (ring `vs_38e6664f…`, arrow `vs_1669b7d1…`; x in vertex bank 3 at +0x4c, the ring's at
   +0x5c, in HUD pixels from the middle), and shifts the three by the viewport to the same side of the
   picture, as far from its edge as from the 16:9 one, past the 2D clip box. Not in the wide view (HUD
   decisions).
3. **Settings** (2026-11-11): `display.ini` `aspect` and `view`, both in the settings menu; all three
   views fight-identical on the Bridge of Eldin replay.
4. **The view changes live** (2026-11-11): every view's hooks are in whenever the picture may be wider
   than 16:9 and each reads the view every frame (`SSBU_VIEW_CYCLE=200` on the Bridge of Eldin replay:
   the same as 16:9).
5. **The picture shape changes without a restart** (2026-11-11): the renderer takes the shape asked for
   at its next present, then every 16:9-shaped render target is released and made again at the new width
   on its next use. Everything else reads the shape live: the camera's +0x164/+0x16c, the HUD wrappers
   (straight through at 16:9), the views (no offset at 16:9). First made to wait for the fight's end;
   the owner tried it in a fight and saw nothing happen, and only online fights need the wait (a hitch
   there is both players'): offline it is taken at once (5 switches mid-fight, the same fight). Online:
   16:9 per match, not per session (OpenSmash.exe starts every session on the lobby; ADR 0002).
6. **Upstream merged** (2026-11-12, 52 commits): `auto` draws with Vulkan on AMD, NVIDIA and Intel cards
   since, so wider pictures need `renderer = direct3d11` until the Vulkan port.
